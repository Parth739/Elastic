# LangGraph

## What is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is a versatile Python library designed for building stateful, cyclic, and multi-actor Large Language Model (LLM) applications . Created by LangChain, LangGraph provides developers with a powerful framework to create complex and flexible agent workflows using stateful graphs and built-in memory management .

## Why Use LangGraph?

While simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can handle basic queries, **LangGraph excels when you need**:
- **Stateful conversations** that remember context across interactions
- **Complex decision-making** with conditional logic
- **Cyclic workflows** where agents can loop back to previous steps
- **Multi-actor systems** where multiple agents collaborate
- **Dynamic task execution** based on real-time decisions

## Key Features

#### **Stateful Architecture**
LangGraph maintains state throughout the entire workflow, allowing agents to remember previous interactions and make contextually aware decisions **Graph-Based Design**
Build reliable, stateful AI systems without giving up control by structuring agent logic as graphs with nodes and edges

#### **Flexible Workflows**
Create autonomous workflows using memory, tools, and LLM orchestration for complex task handling .

## How LangGraph Works in AI Agent Development

LangGraph enables developers to build AI agents that can :
1. **Process information sequentially** or in parallel
2. **Make conditional decisions** based on context
3. **Loop through tasks** until specific conditions are met
4. **Handle multiple inputs** from various sources
5. **Maintain conversation history** and context
